This repo contains the code for my bachelor thesis. Here you can find:
* severin-siffert-ba.pdf: the actual thesis
* code/sTiki-C: code for the constrained devices
* code/STiki-Java: code for the key server

I am not allowed to release the rest of the code publicly. If you ask me at firstanme@lastname.org I can make it available to you.
